Hey! I am Khalil Oxborough, a student at the University of Central Florida at the time of making
this. This program helps you with solving the Wordle, with recommended words as well.

It is imperfect, of course, and I know it doesn't collide too well with repeating letters in the words.

The recommended words are just ways to help narrow it down, but once you get to 20 possible words left
you get a full list of everything it could be.

Good luck! And thank you for checking it out!
